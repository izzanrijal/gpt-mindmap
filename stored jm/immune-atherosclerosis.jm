The retention of apolipoprotein B-rich particles by areas of the vascular network susceptible to atherosclerosis and subsequent engulfment by macrophages is an important early step in the development of atherosclerotic plaque. The role played by immune cells, specifically monocytes and macrophages, in the propagation of atherosclerotic plaque is being studied to develop future therapies that target specific processes to remove or inhibit key steps leading to the establishment of unstable plaque. While much of the work in identifying these steps has been deduced from murine work, understanding the individual contributions made by immune cells to atherosclerotic CVD may provide therapeutic targets for treatment of established disease and the potential for prevention.","expanded":true,"children":[{"id":"891286daa6154355","topic":"How can atherosclerosis lead to heart attack or stroke?","expanded":true},{"id":"891286daaedefff9","topic":"What are plaques and how do they contribute to atherosclerosis?","expanded":true},{"id":"891286daa1f63b72","topic":"What is apolipoprotein B and how does it relate to atherosclerosis?","expanded":true},{"id":"891286daa7cfd011","topic":"What are macrophages and what role do they play in the development of atherosclerotic plaque?","expanded":true},{"id":"891286daa5421166","topic":"How do immune cells, such as monocytes and macrophages, contribute to the propagation of atherosclerotic plaque?","expanded":true},{"id":"891286daa6aa3028","topic":"How is murine work used to identify steps in the development of atherosclerosis?","expanded":true},{"id":"891286daacf4157e","topic":"What potential therapies are being developed to target specific processes in the development of atherosclerosis?","expanded":true},{"id":"891286daa538859e","topic":"How can understanding the individual contributions of immune cells to atherosclerotic CVD lead to therapeutic targets for treatment and prevention?","expanded":true}]}]},{"id":"890fbb39ad34b3fb","topic":"How does the immune system contribute to the development of atherosclerosis?","expanded":true,"direction":"right","children":[{"id":"89122577f4dade3d","topic":"The immune system, particularly monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and lymphocytes, plays a crucial role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis. Monocytes are effector cells of the innate immune system, and their involvement in atherogenesis has been suggested for some time. They exist in subsets in humans and can be described based on their relative expression of antigenic markers such as LPS receptor CD14 and FcÎ³-receptor CD16. Macrophages and dendritic cells also play a role in atherosclerotic plaque, and understanding their contributions may provide the ability to develop future therapies that target very specific processes in order to remove or inhibit key steps leading to the establishment of the unstable plaque. Neutrophil granule proteins can tune monocytic cell function, and the accumulation of myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils in atherosclerotic lesions has been observed in LDLR-/- mice. Finally, lymphocytes have an emerging role in atherosclerotic CVD, with some mouse work suggesting that B cells play a potentially protective role, while some conflicting reports point perhaps to a more subset-specific role as either pro- or anti-atherogenic. In conclusion, delving further into the individual contributions made by immune cells to atherosclerotic CVD may provide therapeutic targets for treatment of established disease and, perhaps, more pertinently, the potential for prevention.","expanded":true,"children":[{"id":"891247b9e751c9a0","topic":"What is the role of monocytes in atherosclerosis?","expanded":true},{"id":"891247b9e907ccdb","topic":"How do macrophages and dendritic cells contribute to the development of atherosclerotic plaque?","expanded":true},{"id":"891247b9e4ccdc55","topic":"What are neutrophil granule proteins and how do they affect monocytic cell function in atherosclerotic lesions?","expanded":true},{"id":"891247b9eea27726","topic":"What is the role of lymphocytes in atherosclerotic CVD?","expanded":true},{"id":"891247b9ed38da2e","topic":"Can B cells play a protective role in atherosclerosis?","expanded":true},{"id":"891247b9ec1e373f","topic":"How can understanding the contributions of immune cells to atherosclerotic CVD help in developing future therapies?","expanded":true},{"id":"891247b9e0c3c483","topic":"What are the potential therapeutic targets for treating established atherosclerotic disease?","expanded":true},{"id":"891247b9e172933b","topic":"How can delving further into the individual contributions made by immune cells potentially prevent atherosclerosis?","expanded":true}]}]},{"id":"890fbb39a24cb588","topic":"What role do macrophages play in the immunology process of atherosclerosis?","expanded":true,"direction":"left","children":[{"id":"89125e48032f269f","topic":"According to the provided document, macrophages play a significant role in the immunological process of atherosclerosis. They are involved in the propagation of atherosclerotic plaque, leading to the establishment of unstable plaque. Macrophages respond to modified lipoproteins and generate lipid-laden foam cells, contributing to further leukocyte recruitment and the generation of an ongoing inflammatory response. Macrophage foam cells have a reduced capacity to emigrate from plaque, resulting in the continued recruitment of other immune cells into the plaque. This process creates an unstable atherosclerotic plaque that is implicated in heart attack and stroke. The role of macrophages in mature plaque macrophage replenishment within the vessel wall is primarily through self-renewal.","expanded":true,"children":[{"id":"891263a2c2bce866","topic":"How do macrophages contribute to the propagation of atherosclerotic plaque?","expanded":true},{"id":"891263a2c6edbf4d","topic":"What is the connection between macrophages and the establishment of unstable plaque?","expanded":true},{"id":"891263a2ceebc755","topic":"How do macrophages respond to modified lipoproteins?","expanded":true},{"id":"891263a2c9d6fb83","topic":"What are lipid-laden foam cells and how do they contribute to the inflammatory response?","expanded":true},{"id":"891263a2cbd05379","topic":"How do macrophage foam cells affect the recruitment of other immune cells into the plaque?","expanded":true},{"id":"891263a2c04b7f39","topic":"What is the role of macrophages in mature plaque macrophage replenishment?","expanded":true},{"id":"891263a2cf63c470","topic":"What is self-renewal and how does it relate to macrophage replenishment?","expanded":true}]}]},{"id":"890fbb39aab94deb","topic":"How do T-cells and B-cells contribute to the development of atherosclerosis?","expanded":true,"direction":"left","children":[{"id":"891253a2b2304905","topic":"According to the provided document, T-cells make up approximately 10% of cells in human atherosclerotic plaque, with 70% of them being CD4+ and the remainder being CD8+.
