This means you need to understand your customers and their motivations first, before trying to sell them on your product or service.  To start, look at your own buying habits and try to uncover the social, emotional, and functional reasons why you made a purchase. Practice helping friends and family with their purchasing decisions, and try to design your presentations to address all three motivations.  To be successful in demand-side sales, you need to articulate the buyer's timeline and the four forces of progress, summarize it into a meaningful story, and design a sales process to help others make progress.  Some effective sales techniques and strategies include framing the problem by understanding the context and outcomes the customer is seeking, asking push, pull, anxieties, and habit questions, and using progress tools to help customers make progress. It's also important to tailor your solutions to meet their specific needs and address their anxieties and tradeoffs.
