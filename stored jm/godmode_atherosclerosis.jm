The role of inflammation and its regulation in atherogenesis and plaque progression, however, is poorly understood. Macrophage foam cells have reduced capacity to emigrate from plaque, thereby contributing to an ongoing inflammatory response, with resulting continued recruitment of other immune cells into the plaque. The hypothesis of atherogenesis includes the role played by oxidation of pro-atherogenic lipoproteins and interaction with proteoglycans in helping to retain them within plaque. Dying macrophages deposit engulfed lipid into the plaque, resulting in a necrotic core that creates an unstable atherosclerotic plaque, implicated in heart attack and stroke. Unlike in early atherosclerotic lesions, where mouse models suggest a reliance on monocyte recruitment, mature plaque macrophage replenishment within the vessel wall is primarily through self-renewal. Understanding in greater detail the role played by monocytes and macrophages in the propagation of atherosclerotic plaque may provide the ability to develop future therapies that target very specific processes in order to remove or inhibit key steps leading to the establishment of the unstable plaque.","expanded":true}]},{"id":"8a0fc7e57d35f6f6","topic":"Understand the relationship between various health conditions and the immune system","expanded":true,"direction":"left"},{"id":"8a0fcbd8a3177064","topic":"Understand the role of cholesterol in atherosclerosis","expanded":true,"direction":"right","children":[{"id":"8a0fedda46b7aea7","topic":"Role of Cholesterol in Atherosclerosis and Modifiable Risk Factors for Cardiovascular Disease Elevated total and LDL cholesterol levels have been implicated in the development of early cardiovascular disease (CVD). Reduction of heart attack and stroke risk have been shown with therapies that successfully lower LDL cholesterol levels. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists' Collaboration showed that a reduction of LDL-C by 1.0 mmol/L equated to a reduction in heart attacks by nearly 25%. The oxidized form of LDL is thought to play a key role in atherogenesis. Smoking has been identified as a key modifiable risk factor for CVD, consistently shown to increase the risk of death from ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke.  Mechanisms of Cardiovascular Regulation The cardiovascular system is regulated by homeostatic processes that maintain blood pressure and blood flow to meet the body's needs. Cholesterol transport plays a role in this regulation, with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) negatively correlated with an increased risk of CVD. HDL is thought to exert cardioprotective effects by removing cholesterol from cells, a process known as \"reverse cholesterol transport.\" HDL also exerts anti-inflammatory effects by lowering expression of endothelial expression of VCAM-1, increasing production of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), and reducing monocyte expression of CD11b and migration.  Overall, the role of cholesterol and dietary lipid in contributing to the burden of CVD is significant. Modifiable risk factors for CVD, such as smoking and elevated total and LDL cholesterol levels, should be addressed to reduce the risk of developing CVD. Therapies that successfully lower LDL cholesterol levels have been shown to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.
